        <p>I am interested in studying the implications of climate change on the suitability and sustainability of
            coffee cultivation, utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and advanced technology-based ecological
            modeling techniques to assess the changing habitat conditions.</p>
        <p>My research interests are centered around investigating the potential impact of future climate change on the
            cultivation of coffee plants and other agricultural crops, by integrating Information Systems and
            cutting-edge technology with the maximum entropy approach to analyze bioclimatic variables and assess their
            suitability in GIS-based models.</p>
        <p>Future projects are:</p>

        <ul>
            <p>• Exploring the impact of climate change on coffee cultivation across different regions using GIS and
                ecological modeling.<br>
                • Developing a technology-driven decision support system to aid coffee farmers in adapting to changing
                climate patterns.<br>
                • Investigating the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting coffee crop yields under
                varying climatic conditions.<br>
                • Conducting a comparative analysis of climate change effects on diverse agricultural crops, including
                coffee, through GIS-based research.<br>
                • Identifying sustainable climate change mitigation strategies for coffee farms and assessing their
                effectiveness using GIS data.<br>
                • Analyzing geospatial coffee market trends in relation to climate change to anticipate future industry
                developments.<br>
                • Assessing the suitability of expanding coffee plantations into new geographic regions based on climate
                change projections using GIS data.</p>
        </ul>
